  {
    question: "How does atmospheric water generation work?",
    answer:
      "Aquion hydropanels use a dual-cycle approach: at night, radiative cooling condenses moisture from air as dew. During the day, solar heating extracts water from desiccant materials. Both processes produce clean, potable water.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much water can one hydropanel produce?",
    answer:
      "Each 1mÂ² hydropanel can produce 15-20 liters of clean water daily under optimal conditions (>40% humidity). Multiple panels can be connected to increase output for larger households or communities.",
  },
  {
    question: "What maintenance does the hydropanel require?",
    answer:
      "Minimal maintenance is required: monthly surface cleaning, desiccant brick replacement every 6 months, and filter changes every 3 months. All maintenance can be performed by trained community members.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a hydropanel cost?",
    answer:
      "Our target cost is $130 per unit for a 10-unit pilot batch, with costs decreasing through local manufacturing. 90% of materials can be sourced locally, reducing transportation costs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the design really open source?",
    answer:
      "Yes! All hardware designs are released under Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license. CAD files, construction manuals, and bill of materials are freely available for replication and modification.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where are hydropanels being tested?",
    answer:
      "Current pilot deployments are in Cape Coast and Ho, Ghana. We're working with local communities and universities to validate performance and refine the design for African conditions.",
